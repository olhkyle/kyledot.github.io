This is my **first post** on my new Blog.

I had been writing my **FrontEnd** Development Contents on **Velog** which is operated by Velopert.

But, from now, I'm gonna write whole of development contents related to my steady growth, engineering retrospects and personal studies.

This Blog is built with **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/why-gatsby)** Framework. Why I choose **Gatsby** is it compiles and builds **faster** than any other framework and it **statically** generates websites with less vulnerabilities in comparison with other frameworks comparatively.

> `Gatsby`, `JavaScript`, `TailwindCSS`, `lodash`

Thank you for coming to my Blog.
